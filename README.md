## Project Overview

### Purpose
A web-based election management system for Jahangirnagar University that handles:
- JUCSU (Central Student Union) elections - 25 positions
- Hall Union elections - 15 positions per hall (21 halls)
- Dual voting (students vote in both elections simultaneously)

### Key Features
- Role-based access control (Voter, Candidate, Central Commissioner, Hall Commissioner)
- Secure voter registration and authentication
- Candidate nomination with proposer/seconder verification
- Hall-specific voting restrictions
- Real-time vote counting
- Results visualization with Chart.js
- Audit logging and complaint management

### User Roles

Summary
Role System:

Voter = Regular student (registers via public form)
Candidate = Voter who nominates (no separate registration)
Commissioner = Created manually by admin (for security)

Login Process:

Students → Register as voter → Can nominate to become candidate
Commissioners → Created by admin → Login with provided credentials

Update Documentation - Add this section to README.md:
markdown## User Registration & Login

### Students (Voters & Candidates)
- Register through public registration page
- All students get 'voter' role initially
- To become a candidate: Login as voter → Go to "Apply for Election"
- Submitting nomination makes you a candidate
- No separate "candidate" login - use same voter credentials

### Commissioners
- Created manually by system administrator
- Cannot self-register for security
- Admin creates account with 'central_commissioner' or 'hall_commissioner' role
- Login with provided credentials



========================================================================================================================================================

**1. Voter (Students)**
- Register and login
- View candidates for both elections
- Cast votes for JUCSU positions
- Cast votes for Hall Union positions
- View their voting status

**2. Candidate (Students who nominate)**

## Authentication System

### How Login Works

```php
// User enters university_id and password
// System checks database
SELECT * FROM users WHERE university_id = ? AND is_active = 1

// Verify password using PHP's password_verify()
password_verify($entered_password, $stored_hash)

// If valid, create session
$_SESSION['user_id'] = user's database ID
$_SESSION['role'] = 'voter' or 'candidate' or 'commissioner'
$_SESSION['university_id'] = user's university ID
$_SESSION['full_name'] = user's name
$_SESSION['hall_name'] = user's hall

// Redirect based on role
redirectToDashboard() // function in includes/functions.php
```

### Protected Pages

Every protected page must start with:
```php
require_once '../includes/check_auth.php';
requireRole('voter'); // or 'central_commissioner', etc.
```

This checks:
1. Is user logged in?
2. Does user have required role?
3. If no → redirect to login or unauthorized page

### Helper Functions Available

Located in `includes/functions.php`:

```php
isLoggedIn()              // Check if user has active session
getCurrentUser()          // Get all data of logged-in user
hasRole($role)            // Check if user has specific role
redirectToDashboard()     // Send user to their dashboard
sanitizeInput($data)      // Clean user input
hashPassword($password)   // Hash password for storage
verifyPassword($pass, $hash) // Check password
```

## How to Start Working

### Initial Setup (First Time Only)

**1. Clone Repository**
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd JUCSU_Election_Management
```

**2. Import Database**
- Open phpMyAdmin: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
- Database already created (jucsu_election_system)
- All tables already exist with sample data

**3. Test Existing System**
- Homepage: http://localhost/JUCSU_Election_Management/
- Try logging in with test accounts
- Verify your assigned pages load (may show errors - that's expected)

### Daily Workflow

**Start of Day:**
```bash
# Get latest changes from team
git pull origin main

# Start XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)
# Start working on your assigned files
```

**During Work:**
- Work ONLY in your assigned folder
- Test your changes frequently
- Don't modify files in other folders
- Ask in WhatsApp if you need help

**End of Day:**
```bash
# Save your progress
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message about what you did"

# Get any new changes from team (important!)
git pull origin main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them or ask for help

# Push your work
git push origin main

# Update team in WhatsApp group
```

### Testing Your Work

**Before Committing:**
1. Test login as different user roles
2. Test your new pages work
3. Check for PHP errors (look in browser console)
4. Test on mobile view (press F12, toggle device)
5. Make sure you didn't break existing pages

---

## Coding Standards

### PHP Standards

**File Structure:**
```php
<?php
// page_name.php
$page_title = "Page Title";
require_once '../includes/check_auth.php';
requireRole('voter'); // or appropriate role

$current_user = getCurrentUser();

// Your PHP logic here (database queries, form processing)

include '../includes/header.php';
?>

<!-- Your HTML here -->

<?php include '../includes/footer.php'; ?>
```

**Database Queries:**
```php
// Always use prepared statements (prevents SQL injection)
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$user_id]);
$result = $stmt->fetch();

// For INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO table (col1, col2) VALUES (?, ?)");
$stmt->execute([$val1, $val2]);
```

**Variable Naming:**
```php
$user_id        // snake_case for variables
$full_name
$has_voted_jucsu

function getUserData() {}  // camelCase for functions
function checkVotingStatus() {}
```

### HTML/Bootstrap Standards

**Use Bootstrap Classes:**
```html
<!-- Cards for content blocks -->
<div class="card mb-3">
    <div class="card-header">Title</div>
    <div class="card-body">Content</div>
</div>

<!-- Responsive grid -->
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">
        Content
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Forms -->
<form method="POST">
    <div class="mb-3">
        <label class="form-label">Label</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" name="field">
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success">Submit</button>
</form>
```

**Always Escape Output:**
```php
// Prevent XSS attacks
echo htmlspecialchars($user_input);

// In HTML
<p><?php echo htmlspecialchars($data); ?></p>
```

### JavaScript Standards

**Form Validation Example:**
```javascript
document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault(); // Stop form submission
    
    // Validate
    const field = document.getElementById('field').value;
    if (field.length < 3) {
        alert('Field must be at least 3 characters');
        return;
    }
    
    // If valid, submit
    this.submit();
});
```

### CSS Standards

**Use Existing Classes First:**
- Check Bootstrap documentation before writing custom CSS
- Add custom CSS to `css/style.css` only if Bootstrap doesn't have it
- Use responsive classes: `col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4`

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Database connection failed"
**Solution:** 
- Check XAMPP MySQL is running
- Verify database name is `jucsu_election_system`
- Check `connection.php` has correct credentials

### Issue: "Headers already sent" error
**Solution:**
- No output before `<?php` tag
- No spaces before `<?php`
- Use `exit()` after `header()` redirects

### Issue: "Call to undefined function"
**Solution:**
- Check you included the file: `require_once '../includes/functions.php'`
- Check function exists in `functions.php`

### Issue: Git merge conflict
**Solution:**
```bash
# See what files have conflicts
git status

# Open conflicting file, look for:
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
teammate's changes
>>>>>>> branch

# Choose which version to keep, remove conflict markers
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
git push
```

### Issue: File upload not working
**Solution:**
- Check folder permissions: `uploads/` folder must be writable
- Check `php.ini`: `upload_max_filesize = 10M`
- Use `move_uploaded_file()` not just `copy()`
